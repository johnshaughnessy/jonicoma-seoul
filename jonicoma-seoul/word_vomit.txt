  The Holographic Web is the idea that rather than web "pages", we'll have web "holograms." 
  These holograms will be available for consumption through virtual or augmented reality web platforms. 
  They will be as diverse as web content is today.
  VR is not about games.

  We've implemented a version of the Holographic Web.
  "A new way of looking at the web"


  PART 1: We build holograms, and you can too.
    Talking about holograms today.
    Yes indeed, the sci fi kind of holograms. 
      e.g. Starwars - real world objects in front of me.
    Room scale games 
      e.g. Her - interacting with your OS
    Fun user interfaces
      e.g. Ironman
    The SDK is available today.

    (Gavan's #VRTechTalk)

  PART 2: Altspace is communication.
    Communicate in the most natural and fulfilling way possible online.

    Properties of communication channels.
    Strengths
      Text : Persistant, searchable, scalable, exact (written language). 
        SLACK, WECHAY, SMS
      Voice : Ephemeral, familiar
      Video : Personal, Micro-expressions, limited body language.
      In person : Context, group communication, presence
      VR (AR) : Anyone, anywhere. Embedded web content. Context-fluid. Customizable H2h interface

    Weaknesses
      Text : Impersonal. Requires effort. Limited.
      Voice : Group communication is difficult. Impossible to embed other content.
      Video : Group communication is difficult. Impersonal 1-to-many. One thing must be in focus.
      In person : All communication is to group. 
      VR (AR) : Accessibility, touch, micro-expressions.

    Stength comes from mixing and matching for specific purposes.
      e.g. Twitch: Video + Text
      e.g. Discord : Text, Voice, Multiplatform
      e.g. Snapchat : Photo, text, ephemeral

    What does ultra-high bandwidth communication look like? 

  PART 3: 
    I/O is more than HCI. HCI shapes HHI.
    Technology is a double edged sword, helping us and harming us.
    (Bret Victor - Humane Representation of Information)
    We are stuck with outdated modes of HCI. 
    Code is algebra. Visual Programming is geometry. We need hybrid + more.
    Human capabilities unused until now.
    What is the ideal HHI? It will shape HCI development.

  PART 4: 
    Interacting through avatars is not the only way.
    How to have safe, public gatherings.
    Who should own the information being exchanged between users?



  Part 5:
    MEMES

  The net is vast and infinite.
    In ghost in the shell, motoko uploads her human mind into the net. 
    She is able to "be" anywhere through her dolls / real-world avatar. We will all do this soon in VR. 
    An avatar is a map of human capabilities to functions of another system.
    Today we map very few of our capabilities.
