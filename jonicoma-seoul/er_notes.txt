NOTES ON ERIC'S TALK

  46 years ago, ARPANET connected a few research labs so that they could communicate papers, research, data, computing power.
  ARPANET were lazer focused on solving the problems right in front of them. 
  Not distracted by what it COULD become.
  Easy to talk about where VR will go in 100 years. 
    Hard to create value TODAY.
    We don't know where VR is going.
  What do we focus on?
    Most investment and time is in gaming.
    Communication vs Gaming - Communication is HUGE compared to gaming.
    If VR affects a billion people, the primary purpose of our headsets will be to communicate with friends and family.
    In virtual spaces - connecting w/ friends, family, loved ones is dramatically different than any other medium. Standing in front of people you get to see once or a few times a year is emotionally impactful.
    Needs to be easy. - VR call.
    VR call for slack.
