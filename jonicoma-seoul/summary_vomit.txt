  Intro
    VR is here, AR is coming. 
    VR is not about games. Communication dwarfs gaming. 
    I/O augments part of what makes us human.
    AltspaceVR's goal is to allow users to communicate in the most natural and fulfilling way possible online. 
    The web is not made of "pages".
    Sharing a computing environment enables extra high-bandwidth communication.


  Communication
    AltspaceVR's goal is to allow users to communicate in the most natural and fulfilling way possible online. 
    Natural:
      Technology is double edged sword.
      I/O is more than HCI, because HCI shapes HHI.
      Our HCI sucks, so our HHI is limited. 
      VR is changing that.
    Fulfilling: 
      Every communication channel has strengths and weaknesses.
      One way to think about communication channels is "information bandwidth."
      Shared computing environments will allow for higher-bandwidth communication than real life.

  Holographic Web
    The web today delivers "apps" to every platform - it's much more than web "pages" of text and hyperlinks. 
    AltspaceVR hosts synchonized "holographic" web - a new way of looking at the web.
